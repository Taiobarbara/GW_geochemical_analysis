# Groundwater Geochemical Analysis – Massaciuccoli Area, Central Italy

This repository contains data, scripts, and analysis workflows for the geochemical characterization of groundwater samples collected from the **Massaciuccoli area (Central Italy)**.  
The project is part of my PhD research on microplastics and groundwater.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

The main objectives of this research are:
- To **analyze major and trace element compositions** of groundwater samples.  
- To **identify geochemical facies** and **hydrochemical evolution trends**.  
- To assess **possible contamination sources** and **water quality suitability**.  
- To apply **multivariate statistical techniques** (e.g., PCA, cluster analysis) for pattern recognition.

## 📂 Repository Structure
### 📊 Data Description
Groundwater samples were collected from wells and springs across the Massaciuccoli basin during multiple field campaigns.
Each sample includes:
- Major ions (Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻)
- Trace elements (Fe, Mn, As, Pb, etc.)
- Field parameters (pH, EC, T, Eh)

### 📈 Analytical Methods
The analytical workflow includes:
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Geochemical diagrams (Piper, Durov, Schoeller)
- Statistical analysis (correlation, PCA, cluster analysis)
